I'm writing this in julia now. It's as easy as python but much faster, and I don't really need any special libraries. The notebooks worth looking at are:

* [write up](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sharnett/tree-power-flow/blob/master/precise%20write%20up.ipynb)
* [power flow equations](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sharnett/tree-power-flow/blob/master/power%20flow%20equation%20revisit.ipynb)
* [julia code](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sharnett/tree-power-flow/blob/master/julia%20algo.ipynb)
