For a particular load bus $k$ and particular candidate solution from its list, we know both the power $P_k$ and the voltage $V_k$. So using the power flow equations below (bottom of this document), we can solve for $P_{0k}$, the power injected by the generator into the connecting line. This will be the quantity we discretize. The sum of these $P_{0k}$ (plus any demand at $G_0$) is what we'll use as a candidate solution when we move up the tree.\n",

For each combination, we look at the sum of the $P$ and keep only one combination per bucket before proceeding. Shuffle the combinations before adding to the buckets to eliminate any bias.
