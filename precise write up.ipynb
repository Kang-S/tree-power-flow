We want to compute a list of $(P,V)$ pairs for the generator that satisfy the combinations of the $(P,V)$ from the loads. Ideally we'd have a solution for every possible combination of the $(P,V)$, but for large $n$ there are too many, so we use an approximation.\n",

The way I've been doing it, the $V$ are always quantities enumerated by me, so I can simply adjust that enumeration to suit the desired 'sufficiently different' criterion for $V$. Once the $V$ are enumerated, $P$ is computed using the power flow equations below. The space of possible $P$ is discretized into buckets, and for a given $V$, only one $P$ is kept per bucket.\n",
